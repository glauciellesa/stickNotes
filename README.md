# Stick-it Notes

StickNotes is a project to learn the **localStorage** web storage API and practice DOM and CSS manipulation.

I worked with localStorage to manage sticknote storage and to do this I used **JSON stringify** to convert data to string as that is the required format to keep data in localStorage and then **JSON parse( )** to converts my data JSON string into a JavaScript object.
